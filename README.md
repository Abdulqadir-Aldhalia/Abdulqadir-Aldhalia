## 🚀 Key Project Highlights

### 🔒 [Universe System (Closed Source | Academic Platform)](https://github.com/Abdulqadir-Aldhalia/Universe-System-Showcase)  
🧠 *Built over 2 years as a capstone thesis—this is my most complex and complete project to date.*

A secure, offline-first academic platform for Universities and Academic institutions built with modern microservices architecture.  
It replaces fragmented workflows (Google Classroom, WhatsApp, paper forms) with a unified ecosystem hosted on **local Libyan servers**.

- 🔐 **Security**: JWT Auth, RBAC, Redis blacklist, and air-gapped encrypted research storage
- 📈 **Scalability**: Dockerized services, Eureka service registry, PostgreSQL optimization
- 📚 **Automation**: GPA calculation engine, academic calendar, time conflict detection
- 🧩 **Architecture**: 12 microservices, API gateway, asynchronous messaging via RabbitMQ
- 🌐 **UI/UX**: React dashboard for college admins, students, and teachers, with role-based views
- 📡 **Offline LMS**: First of its kind in Libya—enables access in low-connectivity areas
- 🇱🇾 **Data Sovereignty**: Fully localized with compliance to Libya's National Education Strategy 2030

## About Me
I’m a **Senior Java Backend Engineer** and **Systems Architect** who believes software should be **built to endure** — not just to work today.  
I design and deliver **complex, high-performance systems** that solve real-world problems, with a focus on **clarity, reliability, and long-term maintainability**.

I’m driven by:
- **Principle over politics** — I choose environments where merit and integrity matter.
- **Depth over noise** — Every project I share reflects real engineering, not just a demo.
- **Impact over vanity** — My work is measured by the problems it solves and the people it empowers.

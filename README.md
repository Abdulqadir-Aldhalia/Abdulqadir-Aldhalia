🚀 **Passionate builder of systems that solve real-world problems.**

Hi, I’m **Abdulqadir Aldhalia** — a Computer Science graduate and systems architect with a relentless drive for designing complex, modular, and high-performance software. Over the past two years, I’ve led the development of **Universe System** — a fully decentralized, microservices-based academic platform engineered from the ground up with security, scalability, and domain-driven architecture in mind.

My work bridges the gap between **deep backend engineering** and **embedded systems**, with a focus on **event-driven architectures**, **asynchronous messaging patterns**, and **zero-downtime deployments** using container orchestration tools and service discovery layers.

I’m obsessed with clean abstractions, bounded contexts, and writing resilient code that thrives under real-world load. Whether I’m building distributed APIs, designing multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure, or hardening security boundaries with JWT/PSK/Redis blacklists — I architect systems to be maintainable, auditable, and production-ready from day one.

Outside backend, I dive into **robotics firmware**, **DevOps pipelines**, and **systems-level tooling** with a passion for squeezing every ounce of performance out of the stack. From domain modeling with C4 diagrams to optimizing JVM memory footprints, I approach software as a craft and architecture as a language.

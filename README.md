🚀 **Passionate builder of systems that solve real-world problems.**

Hi, I’m **Abdulqadir Aldhalia** — a Computer Science graduate and systems architect with a relentless drive for designing complex, modular, and high-performance software. Over the past two years, I’ve led the development of **Universe System** — a fully decentralized, microservices-based academic platform engineered from the ground up with security, scalability, and domain-driven architecture in mind.

My work bridges the gap between **deep backend engineering** and **embedded systems**, with a focus on **event-driven architectures**, **asynchronous messaging patterns**, and **zero-downtime deployments** using container orchestration tools and service discovery layers.

I’m obsessed with clean abstractions, bounded contexts, and writing resilient code that thrives under real-world load. Whether I’m building distributed APIs, designing multi-tenant SaaS infrastructure, or hardening security boundaries with JWT/PSK/Redis blacklists — I architect systems to be maintainable, auditable, and production-ready from day one.

Outside backend, I dive into **robotics firmware**, **DevOps pipelines**, and **systems-level tooling** with a passion for squeezing every ounce of performance out of the stack. From domain modeling with C4 diagrams to optimizing JVM memory footprints, I approach software as a craft and architecture as a language.

## 🚀 Key Project Highlights (Problem → Solution → Impact)

### 🔒 [Universe System (Closed Source | Academic Platform)](https://github.com/Abdulqadir-Aldhalia/Universe-System-Showcase)  
🧠 *Built over 2 years as a capstone thesis — architecture fully implemented, with planned feature expansions.*

**Problem:**  
Universities relied on fragmented tools like Google Classroom, WhatsApp, and paper forms, creating inefficiency, security risks, and poor integration.

**Solution:**  
Designed and implemented a secure, microservices-first academic platform with 12 independent services, JWT authentication, PostgreSQL, React UI, and air-gapped storage for data sovereignty.

**Impact:**  
- Unified academic and administrative workflows into a single platform.  
- Reduced operational complexity and improved security posture.  
- Created a scalable foundation for future feature expansion.

### 🚗 [SAYYAR Smart Vehicle Management System (Desktop App)](https://github.com/Abdulqadir-Aldhalia/SAYYAR-Showcase)  

**Problem:**  
Car businesses lacked a centralized system for tracking vehicles, managing finances, and monitoring operations.

**Solution:**  
Developed a JavaFX desktop application with MVVM architecture, Hibernate ORM, and SQLite database. Integrated real-time stats, maintenance tracking, vehicle scraping, and financial reporting.

**Impact:**  
- Improved operational oversight and reduced manual record-keeping.  
- Increased data accuracy and decision-making speed.  
- Delivered a visually appealing, user-friendly interface.

### 🔐 [License Generator Server (JavaFX Licensing Platform)](https://github.com/Abdulqadir-Aldhalia/License-Server-Showcase)  

**Problem:**  
Commercial desktop applications were vulnerable to piracy and unauthorized use.

**Solution:**  
Built a secure license generation and validation server using Spring Boot and Vaadin, with JavaFX client integration, AES encryption, hardware binding, and offline tolerance.

**Impact:**  
- Protected intellectual property for commercial software.  
- Enabled flexible licensing models.  
- Reduced unauthorized usage and revenue loss.

### 🍽️ [Restaurant Management System (Internship Project)](https://github.com/Abdulqadir-Aldhalia/Restaurant-Management-System)  

**Problem:**  
Restaurants needed a unified system to handle orders, kitchen coordination, and analytics across multiple platforms.

**Solution:**  
Developed RESTful APIs in Go and embedded Rust firmware to synchronize orders across kiosks, apps, and kitchens. Built a React dashboard for real-time analytics.

**Impact:**  
- Streamlined order processing and reduced wait times.  
- Provided real-time analytics for better operational decisions.  
- Enabled cross-platform integration between mobile, web, and embedded devices.
